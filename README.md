# POWER-BI-1
**HR Analytics Dashboard - Power BI Project**
Developed a comprehensive dashboard analyzing employee attrition across 1480 employees. Key metrics included attrition rates by education, age, salary, and job roles. Gained proficiency in Power BI data visualization, DAX functions, and storytelling with data.
The main motive behind the HR Analytics dashboard was to understand the key factors influencing employee attrition within the organization. By analyzing trends across education, age, job roles, and salary brackets, the dashboard provides actionable insights for reducing turnover and improving employee retention strategies.

The conclusion drawn is that certain job roles and education levels, as well as salary ranges and age groups, are more prone to attrition. This allows HR teams to tailor retention efforts, improve work environments, and create more competitive compensation packages.
